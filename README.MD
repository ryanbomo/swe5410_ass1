# SWE5415 Over View README

This is the README.md for my Software Testing II Assignments.  This will have a short overview of each assignment.

## Assignment 1

This assignment has multiple sections that can be distilled down into three bullets:
1. Set up SSH with cs-scompute
2. Develop a program that can do the following:
   * Take an assignment standardized output from stdout and create a matrix with the output.
   * Check the matrix against a program defined test.
3. Test my programs to make sure that they work as intended and are not super easy to break.

This is what I've gathered I need to do from the assignment sheet and in class discussion.

## Assignment 2

From the in-class discussion, this will be a series of scripted and timed tests of Assignment 1. The main language looks like it will be in Bash.

## Created Guides

This section will contain any helpful general guides created for class, along with the latex file they were created with. These guides are generally not part of an assignment and were done in order to help other classmates. Writing these also helps solidify my own understanding.

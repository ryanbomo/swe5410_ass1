# SWE5410 Over View README

This is the README.md for my Software Testing II Assignments.  This will have a short overview of each assignment.

## Assignment 1

This assignment has multiple sections that can be distilled down into three bullets:
1. Set up SSH with cs-scompute
2. Develop a program that can do the following:
   * Take user input specifying which program to get the list from and the paramters to run it with
   * Interface with SSH
   * Run the desired program
   * Get the set of pairs and the size of the set
   * Check the programs output set against a series of tests
3. Test my program to make sure that it works as intended and is not too easy to break 

This is what I've gathered I need to do from the assignment sheet and in class discussion.

# SWE5415 Over View README

This is the README.md for my Software Testing II Assignments.  This will have a short overview of each assignment.

## Assignment 1

This assignment has multiple sections that can be distilled down into three bullets:
1. Set up SSH with cs-scompute
2. Develop a program that can do the following:
   * Take user input specifying which program to get the list from and the paramters to run it with
   * Pipe the output to program
   * Check the programs output set against a series of tests
3. Test my program to make sure that it works as intended and is not too easy to break 

This is what I've gathered I need to do from the assignment sheet and in class discussion.

## Created Guides

This section will contain any helpful general guides created for class, along with the latex file they were created with. These guides are generally not part of an assignment and were done in order to help other classmates. Writing these also helps solidify my own understanding.
